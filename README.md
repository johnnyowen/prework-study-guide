# Prework Study Guide

## Description

I was motivated to build this project to learn more about coding, the languages, and the process of deployment. I built this to have hands on experience before I start a new class. This will give
 you some basic knowledge  about coding topics, and even tell you which topic to study first. I learned  about using the terminal, the basics of Git Hub, and that coding if rewarding when done right.

## Usage

This page provides limited, basic knowledge of a few elements of coding for the use of reading. There are notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript broken into sections for easy reading. Opening the DevTools console will provide you with guidace on what to study first if you aren't sure, although reading them in order is a great way to do it.
